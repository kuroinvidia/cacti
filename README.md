#Cacti
i need you to know before you run script cacti.sh
you need to install package dos2unix
If you're not using Git, you simply need to convert these affected files/scripts back into Unix-like line endings (LF), either by

apt install dos2unix -y
dos2unix cacti.sh

then you can ran bash with it! You just need run bash dos2unix.sh and all be fine
For your information i make default password to 'admin' if you want change just do it
